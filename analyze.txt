# Java Spring DevOps Project Prompt: Precision Viticulture Platform

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive DevOps implementation for a Precision Viticulture Platform using Java Spring Boot microservices architecture. The project should be fundamentally different in structure and approach from previous implementations while maintaining agricultural focus.

## Architecture Requirements
- Use Java Spring Boot 3.x with Spring Cloud for microservices
- Implement event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka
- Use PostgreSQL for main data storage and Redis for caching
- Deploy using Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes
- Implement API Gateway pattern using Spring Cloud Gateway
- Use JWT-based authentication and authorization

## Service Structure
1. **Vineyard Management Service** - Manages vineyard plots, grape varieties, and seasonal activities
2. **Sensor Data Service** - Collects and processes IoT sensor data from vineyards
3. **Weather Integration Service** - Integrates weather forecasts and historical climate data
4. **Analytics Service** - Performs predictive analytics for harvest timing and disease prevention
5. **Notification Service** - Manages alerts and notifications for critical events
6. **Market Intelligence Service** - Tracks wine market prices and demand trends

## DevOps Implementation Requirements
- Use Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines (instead of GitHub Actions)
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- Use Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments
- Implement comprehensive logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Implement chaos engineering practices using Chaos Monkey
- Use Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Implement service mesh with Istio for traffic management
- Use Vault for secrets management
- Implement GitOps workflow with ArgoCD
- Use SonarQube for code quality analysis
- Implement backup and disaster recovery with Velero
- Use Nexus or JFrog Artifactory for artifact management

## Security Requirements
- Implement OAuth2 with Spring Security
- Use Vault for secret management
- Implement API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Secure inter-service communication with mutual TLS

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests using JUnit 5 and Mockito
- Integration tests using TestContainers
- Contract testing with Spring Cloud Contract
- Performance testing with Gatling
- Security testing with OWASP ZAP integration

## Documentation Requirements
- API documentation using Springdoc OpenAPI (Swagger)
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Deployment guides for different environments
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Performance Requirements
- Sub-200ms response time for 95% of API requests
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent sensor connections
- Zero-downtime deployments during critical growing seasons
- Auto-scaling based on sensor data volume

## Monitoring and Observability
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Custom business metrics related to vineyard operations
- Real-time dashboard for vineyard health monitoring
- Automated alerting for critical thresholds

## Deliverables Structure
1. Executive Summary with business value proposition
2. Technical Architecture Document
3. Complete CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
4. Security Implementation Guide
5. Testing Strategy and Results
6. Performance Benchmarking Report
7. Monitoring and Observability Setup
8. Deployment Playbooks
9. Maintenance and Operations Manual

## Unique Differentiators Required
- Focus on seasonal agricultural patterns in system design
- Edge computing capabilities for remote vineyard locations
- Integration with satellite imagery and drone data
- Predictive maintenance for agricultural equipment
- Carbon footprint tracking and sustainability metrics
- Multi-tenancy support for vineyard management companies
- Offline-first capabilities for areas with poor connectivity
- Blockchain integration for wine provenance tracking

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow Spring Boot best practices and conventions
- Implement clean architecture principles
- Use reactive programming where appropriate for high-throughput operations
- Apply domain-driven design concepts
- Include comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for service resilience
